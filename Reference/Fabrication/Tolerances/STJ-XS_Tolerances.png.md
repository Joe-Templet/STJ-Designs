## Backlinks

%% Points to the backlinks of the non-markdown file itself. Works excellent with images, need to test on any data type including those with possible editability %%

```dataview
table
where contains(file.outlinks, link(replace(this.file.path,".md","")))
where file.link != this.file.link
```
